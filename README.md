## Setup
To get this project started locally you will first need a couple of things. First you need to clone the repo. Now you need node to run it. If you are on linux you can simply run `sudo apt install nodejs` on the command line. If you are on windows or macos. You can go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). To very it is installed you can run `node -v`. If you have installed it you will see `v12.22.9`. Now all we need to do is 

~~~
cd algorithm-visualizer
~~~

~~~
npm install
~~~
This will install all the necessary packages to run the project. Once it is done you can run it like this:

~~~
npm start
~~~

To find where the sorting algorithms are implemented go to `src/SortingAlgorithms`. There you can find the algorithms and how they are implemented. You can also implement your own. Just make sure to import it into `App.js` :) .


### Deployment

This was deployed on heroku and can be found [here](https://gaelgil.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/)
